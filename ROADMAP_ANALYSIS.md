# Roadmap Analysis: Practical Feature Assessment

This document provides a critical analysis of the proposed roadmap features based on real-world usage patterns and the practical needs of LLM-assisted development workflows.

## Executive Summary

Many proposed "intelligent" features duplicate capabilities that LLMs already possess. The most valuable additions are simple, focused tools that fill specific gaps LLMs cannot easily address, such as efficient pattern validation and dependency tracking across large codebases.

## Key Insight

> "When this tool has been added to mcp contexts, without actually requesting you use it, you tend to use other tools."

This observation reveals that complex, specialized tools often get bypassed in favor of simpler, more direct approaches. The most successful MCP tools are **simple, fast, and fill specific gaps**.

## Feature Assessment

### ❌ Features to Skip (Over-Engineered)

#### `search_by_intent`
- **Why Skip**: LLMs already excel at translating natural language to ast-grep patterns
- **Current Solution**: User describes intent → LLM generates pattern → Use existing search
- **Complexity**: Would require NLP/ML infrastructure for marginal benefit

#### `analyze_change_impact`
- **Why Skip**: Too complex to implement reliably; users prefer seeing actual changes
- **Current Solution**: Use `dry_run: true` and review changes directly
- **Complexity**: Risk scoring and impact analysis are highly context-dependent

#### `learn_project_patterns`
- **Why Skip**: LLMs learn patterns naturally by reading code
- **Current Solution**: LLMs analyze code structure on-demand
- **Complexity**: Would require massive ML infrastructure

#### `detect_code_smells`
- **Why Skip**: Established tools (ESLint, SonarQube) already excel at this
- **Current Solution**: Integrate with existing linting tools
- **Complexity**: Reinventing the wheel

#### `verify_transformation_safety`
- **Why Skip**: Extremely complex to guarantee correctness
- **Current Solution**: Dry-run + human review + test suite
- **Complexity**: False sense of security if not 100% reliable

### ⚠️ Features with Questionable Value

#### `find_similar_patterns`
- **Assessment**: LLMs can identify similar code by reading files
- **Alternative**: Use existing search with LLM-generated pattern variations

#### `generate_test_cases`
- **Assessment**: Very framework-specific; LLMs already generate tests well
- **Alternative**: Use LLM with framework knowledge

#### `bulk_refactor`
- **Assessment**: Current `file_replace` with patterns already handles this
- **Alternative**: Use existing batch operations

### ✅ Features Worth Building

#### 1. Basic Dependency Tracking
```typescript
interface FindUsageParams {
  symbol: string;
  type: "imports" | "calls" | "definitions";
  scope?: string;
}
```
- **Value**: LLMs cannot efficiently search entire codebases for usage
- **Implementation**: Simple AST traversal for symbol references
- **Use Case**: "Find all places where this function is imported"

#### 2. Pattern Validation Tool
```typescript
interface ValidatePatternParams {
  pattern: string;
  test_code: string;
  language: string;
}
```
- **Value**: Reduces trial-and-error in pattern development
- **Implementation**: Run pattern against test code, return matches
- **Use Case**: "Does this pattern match what I expect?"

#### 3. Simple Change Preview
```typescript
interface PreviewChangesParams {
  pattern: string;
  replacement: string;
  path_pattern: string;
}
```
- **Value**: Quick safety check before applying changes
- **Implementation**: List affected files and match counts
- **Use Case**: "Show me what files would be affected"

## Recommended Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Excellence (Immediate)
1. **Fix existing issues**
   - 3 failing language injection tests
   - Edge case handling
   - Error message clarity

2. **Performance optimization**
   - Large codebase handling
   - Parallel processing improvements
   - Memory efficiency

3. **Reliability improvements**
   - Better error recovery
   - Graceful handling of malformed code
   - Timeout handling for large operations

### Phase 2: High-Value Additions (Next Quarter)
1. **`find_usage`** - Basic dependency tracking
2. **`validate_pattern`** - Pattern testing tool
3. **`preview_changes`** - Simple impact preview

### Phase 3: Polish (Future)
1. **`extract_documentation`** - Only if implementation stays simple
2. **Enhanced language injection** - Better embedded language support
3. **Performance profiling** - Help users optimize patterns

## Design Principles

### What Makes a Good MCP Tool Feature

1. **Fills a specific gap** - Does something LLMs cannot do efficiently
2. **Simple interface** - Minimal parameters, predictable behavior
3. **Fast execution** - Sub-second response for common operations
4. **Composable** - Works well with other tools and LLM workflows
5. **Reliable** - Consistent results, good error handling

### What to Avoid

1. **Duplicating LLM capabilities** - Natural language processing, code understanding
2. **Complex interfaces** - Many parameters, configuration options
3. **"Smart" features** - Trying to be intelligent often reduces reliability
4. **Monolithic solutions** - Better to have focused tools that compose well

## Implementation Guidelines

### For New Features

1. **Start with the simplest possible implementation**
2. **Validate with real users before adding complexity**
3. **Prefer explicit over implicit behavior**
4. **Design for composability with LLM workflows**
5. **Measure actual usage after deployment**

### Success Metrics

- **Adoption Rate**: Is the feature actually used when available?
- **Time Saved**: Does it meaningfully speed up workflows?
- **Error Rate**: How often does it produce incorrect results?
- **User Feedback**: Do users request enhancements or report issues?

## Conclusion

The ast-grep MCP tool should focus on being the **best possible structural search and replace tool** rather than trying to become an AI-powered code intelligence platform. Simple, focused features that complement LLM capabilities will see far more adoption than complex "intelligent" features that duplicate what LLMs already do well.

The highest-value additions are those that provide capabilities LLMs lack: efficient symbol tracking across large codebases, pattern validation, and simple change previews. These features are relatively simple to implement but provide immediate, tangible value to users.
